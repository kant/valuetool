valuetool
=========

This is a fork from the original valuetool which I am going to extend with new features during working on my masterthesis called "Analysing multitemporal rasterdata with QGIS".

You can find all new features under the `Time` tab inside the plugin.

While working on it I also removed some bugs and nasty behaviour from the "original" valuetool - and probably introduced new ones ;).
Everyone is very welcome to test this plugin and report issues.

Some of the best new introduced features need some Documentation (like the new selection by regexp) but I guess for advanced users it should be pretty much self explaining.

Have fun!
